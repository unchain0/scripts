# Python rules

- Always run the code using **uv** package manager, for example: 'uv run weather.py'.
- Make only that was requested, do not implement any more or any less.
- If you need install some package, use 'uv add package'.
- Whenever possible, use 'Path' from pathlib instead of 'os'
- Use 'pt-br' to write docstrings and comments, use 'en-us' to write logs, prints, variable names, etc.
